        "The sub-regions considered for evaluation in the BraTS 21 challenge are the \"enhancing tumor\" (ET), the \"tumor core\" (TC), and the \"whole tumor\" (WT). The ET is described by areas that show hyper-intensity in T1Gd when compared to T1, but also when compared to “healthy” white matter in T1Gd. The TC describes the bulk of the tumor, which is what is typically resected. The TC entails the ET, as well as the necrotic (NCR) parts of the tumor. The appearance of NCR is typically hypo-intense in T1-Gd when compared to T1. The WT describes the complete extent of the disease, as it entails the TC and the peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue (ED), which is typically depicted by the hyper-intense signal in FLAIR [[BraTS 21]](http://braintumorsegmentation.org/).\n",
